[Predicting Early Mortage Model]

[Dataset Information]
  1. 2023_dataset: It is the full csv of 2023. If you run code from pre-processing step, please use this data.
  2. Dataset_for_Modeling: It is cleaned data for modeling. We selected columns we need and added external in one dataframe. If you run code from modeling step, please use this data

We recomment to use 'Dataset_for_Modeling' data. Because the volumne of 2023yr full data, maybe It occurs RAM limitation. In my case, I purchased google Colab Pro to solve.
If you don't have enough RAM (over 16GB), I recommend to use second dataset.
